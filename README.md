CS50 brought me here

Hi buddies!
My name is Sandri and I've been looking for something cool to do! So tried CS50, and viola, here's me joining Github.

Please bear with me since I'm new on this field since my main work here in the Philippines is accounting. Bit far from my profession, right?

But I know I'll find fun here along the way! Hopefully we can get along soon!
